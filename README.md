## Overview

**ARAS** is a sophisticated, concurrent project management system designed to simulate and manage complex projects with intricate resource allocation, task dependencies, and potential failure points. Built using modern C++, **ARAS** leverages advanced features like multithreading, synchronization primitives, and an event-driven architecture to provide a robust and insightful model of real-world project execution.

## Features

*   **Concurrent Project Execution:** Utilizes multithreading to run multiple projects simultaneously, maximizing resource utilization and simulating real-world scenarios.
*   **Priority-Based Scheduling:** Implements a priority queue to ensure that high-priority projects are executed first.
*   **Resource Management:**  Manages tools and materials efficiently, allocating them to projects based on blueprint requirements.
*   **Adaptable Tools:** Tools can be adapted with specific parameters, providing flexibility in project execution.
*   **Detailed Blueprints:** Blueprints define project requirements, including tools, materials, and execution logic.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to catch and manage potential issues like resource shortages, tool malfunctions, and unexpected project failures.
*   **Event-Driven System:** A rudimentary event system allows listeners to react to project events like enqueueing, starting, completing, or failing.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Comprehensive logging provides insights into project execution, resource allocation, and error occurrences.
*   **Customizable Execution Logic:** Projects can have unique execution logic defined through lambda functions, allowing for a wide range of simulated scenarios.

How It Works
Project objects encapsulate everything needed to complete a task (blueprint, status, and priority).
Blueprint objects describe which tools and materials you need, along with the specific logic to execute (such as welding, painting, or 3D printing).
ProjectManager maintains a std::priority_queue of pending projects. A background thread monitors this queue:
Pulls the highest-priority project.
Executes it, from resource acquisition to blueprint logic.
Triggers event listeners when the project starts, completes, or fails.
If concurrency is your labyrinth, the code’s condition variables and thread synchronization will be your best (or worst) friend.

Future Directions
Network Integration: Expose an API to enqueue projects remotely—an Arcane Foundry in the cloud, if you will.
Dependency Graphs: Let projects depend on the outputs of prior tasks, weaving a grand tapestry of interconnected steps.
Advanced Tool Calibration: Extend the adapt(...) logic to handle real-world sensor feedback, dynamically adjusting weld temperatures or print layer thickness.
